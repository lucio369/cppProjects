/*
The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ... The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
Write a recursive function fib(n) that returns the nth Fibonacci number. n is 0 indexed, which means that in the sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ..., n == 0 should return 0 and n == 3 should return 2.
Assume n is less than 15.
Even though this problem asks you to use recursion, more efficient ways to solve it include using an Array, or better still using 3 volatile variables to keep a track of all required values. Check out this blog post to examine better solutions for this problem.
Examples:

fib(0) ==> 0

fib(1) ==> 1

fib(3) ==> 2

#include <iostream>

int fib(int n){
  if (n<0){
    return -1;
  }
  else if (n==0){
    return 0;
  }
  else if (n==1){
    return 1;
  }
  else{
    return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2);
  }
}
int main(){
  int value;
  std::cout << "Input index for sequence: ";
  std::cin >> value;
  std::cout << "Answer: " << fib(value) << "\n";
  return 0;
}
